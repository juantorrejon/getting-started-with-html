<p><b>Think like a Programmer: </b><br>
1. Procedural Thinking: create instructions that the machine would understand. Machines not like people. Need detailed procedures to perform task <br>
2. Abstract Thinking: find similarities. Is this the same as reusing code that peform similar things but in diferent context, like repeating header of a webpage througout a website? <br>
3. Systems Thinking: break down problem/project into smaller tasks.  <br>
4. Technological Empathy: think like a machine <br>
5. Debugging:  Systematic process to find out what is causing a program to error out/crash.<br><br>

Questions:<br>
What is object oriented programming? Is object oriented used for web pages or IOS applications?
</p>
        <p> Anyone can learn to program! I hope so..</p>
<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
  and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".<br>
  Investigate further: <em>What is CSS? What is JS? (seen in codepen window frames)</em><br>
  <b><u><em>HTML 1.0 - 4.0 (and XHTML)</em></u></b> were all specifications for laying out text and images on a page.  Later revisions included some attempts at providing semantic data which allows basically for automated categorization and correlation of HTML documents.<br>

  <em><b><u>HTML5</u></b></em> actually strives to be something very different.  It aims to be more of an application development platform, which includes not only laying out text and images, but also playing video and audio, interactive 2d and 3d graphics, storing data in the application, dealing with online and offline access to data, and real-time networking protocols for exchanging data as it happens.

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
  explains the distinction well.
</p>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program. Debuggin important. 
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.
